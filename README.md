# hello-world
Just I want to learn about GitHub... any suggestions?

Now, I want to create a repository  directory to start working in. So, I get to work creating a `readme` file. I understand that this is an important part of the documentation of any work. 

It is important for me to save time and don't spent it. So, it's better to be smart.
